Feature: Running Out

#  **In order to** never run out beverage
#
# **As a** shop keeper
#
# **I want to** be informed that there is a shortage and to send a email notification
#  to the company so that they can come and refill the machine.
#
#  The users of the coffee machine are complaining that there is often shortages
#  of water and/or milk. It takes weeks before the machine is refilled.
#  Your product owner wants to you to take advantage of the machine capabilities
#  to inform the user that there is a shortage
